# Status Updates

Undoubtebly you (and I) will have to give multiple updates across a career. This seems like a menial thing to do, but a good update often goes unnoticed whilst a poor one can leave stakeholders confused and concerned.

- _Don't_ over explain your update. Sometimes, especially with very senior stakeholders, I've felt a need to 'prove' my knowledge. This has led to me explaining myself into a topic that I am less comfortable in and have less knowledge. It also dilutes from what your update actually is.
- _Do_ Plan every update before you give it. Use OneNote or similar to write down the update **tailored** toward who is receiving the update. The following should be some considerations:
  - What are the updates that you want to communicate and are important to the stakeholder?
  - How do you want to communicate the update. What are the salient points? How can you keep it clear and concise?
