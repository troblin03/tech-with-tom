# Best Practices for Git

- Although primarily developed for collaboration, Git is also vital when working alone. Being able to rely on and evaluate versioned code is really useful.
- Only use _atomic commits_ that is commits that relate directly to the feature or task of your programme.
- In the same vein, write useful and clear commit messages.
- For an easier message writing experience. In VSC we can just type `git commit` and then a new tab will come up to create richer commit messages.
