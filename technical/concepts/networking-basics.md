# Networking Basics

The OSI 7-Layer Model is a way of providing foundational knowledge on the topic of networking. As you might imagine, there are 7 layers to be concerned with:

1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

This is known as the 'networking stack'. We can divide the layers into two groups. Layers 1-3 are named the _media layers_ which are concerned with how the data is moved from point A to point B.
4-7 are known as the _host layers_ concern how the data is chopped up and reassembled for transport, and how it is interrogated at the end of a network.

At a high-level, in layer 7 you may have a web browser and a web server. The way data moves through the layers is from the web browser (7) to a physical network card or interface (1) where it is exchanged and passsed back up to the web server (7).
