# What is Software Architecture?

Software architecture is often referred to as the foundational element of software design. In terms of interaction between the two, software architecture defines the 'big picture' whilst software design is concerned with the specific details to actually make that happen.

> Software architecture involves understanding and organising a system, all of its components, their interactions, the environment in which they operate, and the core principles which will be used to design the software.

The software architecture is developed with the mission statement or project goal in mind and serves for the rest of the software design.

###### Key features of software architecture

There are four key features that software architecture aims to deliver upon:

- Help stakeholders to visualise, understand, and analyse a system's qualities
- A focus on structure rather than implementation
- Anticipate expensive choices in a project before they are made
- Provide a basis for making core decisions to ensure high-quality work

Because software architecture is at the intersection of technology and business, a key responsibility is to provide _context_ for both sides to understand where the technical solution is going and what it needs to achieve. This can be split into three main areas:

1. The functional requirements
   - What should the system do?
2. Non-functional requirements?
   - Functionality
   - Reliability
   - Usability
   - Efficiency
   - Maintainability
   - Scalability
3. Restrictions
   - Legal requirements
   - Standards
   - Cost
   - Time-to-market
   - Talent hiring
