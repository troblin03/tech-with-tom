# Layered Pattern Architecture

Also referred to as database-driven architecture, it is one of the most common approaches and is a useful way of storing information in easily accesible tables.

In this layered approach, data begins at the top layer and works its way down until it reaches the bottom (often a database). Each layer has a different task which focuses the data and solves issues with the data.
