# Public vs Private vs Multi vs Hybrid Cloud

## Public Cloud

Platforms that are available to the general public. They meet the five key cloud characteristics, and are available to the public. Some systems may use _multiple_ cloud vendors to achieve their cloud goals. This is what's called **multi-cloud**.

Multi-cloud provides you with provide resilient architectures.

## Private Cloud

Solutions that are dedicated to your business and run from your business premises (an on-premises solution). For AWS this is know as AWS Outposts.

A private cloud _still_ needs to meet the five characteristics of the cloud, but is simply available on premises for the customer.

## Hybrid Cloud

A combination of the two above. However, it must be a public and private _cloud_, not a public cloud run on on-premises infrastructure (this may refer to a hybrid environment instead).
