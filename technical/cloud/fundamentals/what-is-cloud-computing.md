# What is Cloud Computing?

NIST is the US National Institute of Science & Technology (NIST), and they have provided 5 key characteristics that makes the cloud, the cloud.

## 1. On-demand self-service

You can provision capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction. 'Capabilities' refers to features or products, eg. databases, networks, storage etc. For major cloud providers, you can do this with the command line, the management console etc. You don't need to interact with a bhuman to provision capabilities.

## 2. Broad network access
You can access services over any networks, using standard protocols and methods.

## 3. Resource pooling

There is a sense of location independence. I.e. you have no control over the exact location of the resources you are provisioning. Resources are also pooled to serve multiple customers using a multi-tenant model.

## 4. Rapid elasticity

Capabilities can be rapidly provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning appear unlimited.

## 5. Measured service

Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, reported and billed. This is in comparison to previous provisioning which required significant capex up front. You would generally pay nothing in advance.
