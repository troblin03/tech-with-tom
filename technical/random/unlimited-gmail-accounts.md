# Unlimited Gmail Accounts

By default, Gmail comes with a feature to allow you to create unlimited accounts unique e-mails that all link back to the same core e-mail. 

Let's say that your core email you created is: myemail@gmail.com

By using the + symbol, you can create a number of e-mail addresses that link back to your original account. E.g:

myemail+account1@gmail.com

myemail+account2@gmail.com

All of these are unique, but direct mail back to your core account! This is referred to as a **Dynamic Alias**.
