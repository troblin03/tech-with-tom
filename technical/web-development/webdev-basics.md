# Basic Web Development Concepts

## HTML, CSS, and Javascript

HTML and CSS are two programming languages that combine to create everything you (the user) sees when you look at something on the internet.

HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It determines how documents and web pages are displayed in a web browser. As a langueag, it is the building blocks of any website.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a popular sheet style language determining how a document created in HTML is styled (eg. font, colours, layout).

Javascript is another language that allows you to change HTML and CSS elements on your website after the site has been loaded. This provides the ability to make the site more interactive and engaging for users.

###### HTML

HTML is relatively simple, but incredibly powerful. If you want to display certain text, and that text to be bold, then HTML can do this without issue. HTML is really the foundations and structure of your website. CSS and Javascript can be applied on top of HTML to enhance the design.

###### CSS

The main focus of CSS is almost entirely on improving the presentation of HTML elements. Although only a static programming language, CSS can make a website appear sleek and modern. In fact, newer CSS versions allow for some animations to be created.

###### Javascript

Of the three, Javascript certainly has more depth in web development being available for us in both front and back-end web dev. In front-end, Javascript provides the tools to alter the behaviour of specific elements. An example are the 'hamburger' menus that pop out with detailed options when selected on a website.
