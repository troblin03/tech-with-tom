# HTML Lists

In HTML, we can encounter two different types of lists, _ordered_ and _unordered_ lists.

###### Unordered Lists

An unordered list such as a shopping list is a list of information that can be approached in any order. It is designated using the following:

```
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  ...
</ul>
```

and will appear as bullet points

###### Ordered Lists

Lists in which the order does matter are tagged differently:

```
<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  ...
</ol>
```

and will appeared numbered
