# HTML Elements and Tags

Almost all elements on a HTML web page are pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing **tags**.

A tag is created by enclosing a keyword in angled brackets `<>`. Closing tags are detailed in the smae way, except the angled brackets contain a forward slash before the keyword to indicate that this is a closing tag `</>`.

These tags and the enclosed content comprise an **element**. The browser evaluates the element designated by the tags to determine how the content should be formatted and presented.

Some HTML elements do not have a closing tag. These are known as _self-closing tags_ because they don't wrap any content.

There are a number of predefined tags for HTML, and appropriate use of tags is vital for accesibility and availability of your website.
