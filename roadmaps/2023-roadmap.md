# My Technical Roadmap

## Goal

I want a job that combines technical expertise with consulting soft skills. As a result, I want to learn to work in the cloud. This seems like a crossover 
between technology and consulting that I'm looking for.

To achieve this, I need to up my technical proficiency whilst still gaining the soft skills through my consulting work. This document aims to define my roadmap 
to upskilling. I'm doing this because I'm struggling to stay on one learning path. I'll define this prior to 2023 starting and see how far I progress through it.

## High Level View

In order to achieve the goal above, I need to think about and target areas that will carry me towards the destination. To my head there are three specific areas I want to target for different reasons:

1. **HTML, CSS, JavaScript -** Just because of the field I'm embarking on, I think that these are important to have at least an awareness of. This is primarily so I can build my own things end to end and gain an understanding of what that involves. This will not be my focus. I would estimate wanting to spend approximately 20 % of my time on this.
2.  **Python -** There are two aims in upskilling in python. The first is for backend web development. Essentially I want to focus on backend infrastructure because to my mind it is more universal than frontend. Django and Flask are widely used and have plenty of documentation and hence will be my focus. The second aspect is for automation. This is less familiar to me but from what I've read is important for working in tech and big tech especially. About 40 % of my time should be on this.
3.  **Cloud (AWS) -** I have limited this to AWS but pending oppurtunity /  learning the breadth of this may expand. I would like to primarily explore the architecture route. Gaining an understanding of different use cases and gaining some practical experience. About 40 % of my time should be on this.

## 1. HTML, CSS, and Javascript

###### Checklist

- [ ] TOP - Foundations
- [ ] TOP - Full Stack Javascript

###### Resources

https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard - The Odin Project

###### Progress Log

19/12/2022 - Created personal roadmap. Decided to narrow my focus in this area to the Odin Project. This will give me a clear focus and idea of progress. As far as I've read, it covers the fundamentals of these three aspects extremely well. It also covers node.js (I think?) but I'll review whether this is omething I want to delve in to later on.

## 2. Python

###### Checklist

- [ ] Helsinki MOOC Course
- [ ] Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

###### Resources

https://programming-22.mooc.fi/ - 2022 Helsinki MOOC

https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ - Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

###### Progress Log

19/12/2022 - Created personal roadmap. Selected two resources to learn Python: Helsinki MOOC. Has a great reputation for a starter course, I'm already part of the way through and want to ensure my basics are up to scratch before delving too deep. Following this I will tackle 'Automate the Boring Stuff'. Another course with a great reputation and I'm hoping it will teach me the basics of identifying and automating tasks.

## 3. Cloud (AWS)

###### Checklist

- [ ] Cantrill Solutions Architect Associate
- [ ] Cantrill Developer Associate

###### Resources

https://learn.cantrill.io/ - Cantrill AWS Courses

###### Progress Log

19/12/2022 - Created personal roadmap. Because AWS is used to support applications, resources are more difficult to find without them being overly 'handhold-y'. One that has received positive reviews online is learn.cantrill. Having reviewed it, it seems exactly what I want / need. It's a one-time-fee of around Â£40 so I don't have to worry about zooming through resources, and it looks heavily practical focussed which is brilliant. I'm even looking at the Developer Associate course alongside the Solutions Architect Associate.
